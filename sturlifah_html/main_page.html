								I have a large background in the oil and gas industries. Industries like 
								this have given me a huge perspective on what real true hard work and
								teamwork can do when trying to carry out a huge feat. The experience and
								knowledge I have gained in such a field has ever changed me as a person.
								In more recent years I been involved in the procurement business. 
								Exporting of U.S. goods has been a huge factor in my involvement. The
								success of international relations, sales and marketing have been huge
								stepping-stones to my success in the industry. Such a field has shaped
								and molded me on a whole new scale of professionalism in my life. And I
								owe it to this path for my now steady, sure bow as I aim and shoot for
								goals in my life. From swinging sledge hammers on rocky boats during
								stormy nights to closing extensive sales deals in the cool A/C of an
								office, I have not only gained physical, but mental endurance and strength
								as well. Such experience has made me who I am today. But despite the diversity
								of my career path, my true passion though has always been with my creativity.
								Anything from art to designing from disassembling and recreating, I have
								always found joy and great success when I can allow my creativity to
								immerse in my actions and passions. Not too long ago, I got inspired by
								the IT field, particularly mobile app and website designing. The idea
								that I could finally have the chance to use my creativity at its most by
								designing and creating functional yet creative applications and websites
								overwhelmingly peaked my interest. The fact that such a field has such an
								impact on todays and the futures society pretty much sold me. So I have 
								spent a lot of time learning the field and finding my place in the
								massive frame-work of the industry. Actually, this website is the first
								accomplishment of mine in the field. I will continue my passion in this
								market by not only website designing, but I would also like my artistic side
								to surface and expand as well by designing logos, back drops, characters,
								and more. I not only want my websites functional, but I want them
								visually stimulating as well. I want to leave my imprint.

								By day, I test software as an automation developer; by night, I test boundaries of 
								normality by exploring myself and the wide wild world around me. I have high standards 
								when it comes to quality analysis and work ethics, as well as to myself (if not higher). 
								In my never-ending pursuit for excellence, I never stop learning, exploring, experiencing. 
								Challenge is my fuel, motivation is my road, positive results of my work is my reward. 
								I have lived in several countries, finished several highest degrees and worked in various 
								positions from a director of development in a rare disease non-profit foundation, to a 
								current job of a software automation developer in a large bank. Software is my passion. 
								It is like a living and breathing organism, always changing, always evolving, never the 
								same. Keeping up with the IT industry pushes me to always be on my tippy toes. I do 
								freelancing on uTest, UpWork and Testilo to stay current with my competition. Aside of 
								testing software, I enjoy testing my physical abilities by working out daily, as the saying 
								goes, 'Mens sana in corpore sano', a healthy mind in a healthy body. I also test my caffeine 
								tolerance by being an avid coffee drinker. I am always open to exploring all things new and 
								all things unexperienced. I am intrigued by traveling, art, armchair philosophy, weird facts,
								podcasts, fabulous food, and even better conversations. Always seeking to be inspired, to 
								envision the unlikely, to work hard for things that are worth it, and to be surrounded by 
								those who bring out the best in me.
