				<p>Why invest in the real estate market. Lets look at some main
				focus points</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Cash Flow: Can be the net gain from a rental properly after
						all general mortgage expenses are deducted. Which is received
						every month, or you can break even and have that rental income
						cover your mortgage.
					</li>
					<li>
						Property Depreciation: The government will allow owners a deduction from
						their taxes of the property over it's life span.
					</li>
					<li>
						Tax Deductions and Benefits: The owner can usually claim the interest gained
						from the monthly mortgage payment as an additional tax deduction. Repairs or
						improvements on the property can be written off as a tax deductions as well.
						As a real estate investor, keeping your property a float is a business, thus
						there are many business expenses that can be written off as well from office
						supplies used in relation to the property, gas used to driving to properties or
						investment related trips, etc. There are many write-offs one can gain from.
						Make sure to higher a great CPA.
					</li>
					<li>
						Leverage: As some lenders will allow a down payment as low as 3.5% (FHA Loan) up to 
						20% (conventional load), one could really spread the money around. Let's say you have $100,000.00 is assets
						to spend, you may be able to purchase 2 or 3 properties instead of paying for 1
						property in full, thus may result in a large return from all 3 versus the 1.
					</li>
					<li>
						Amortization: Basically paying down loans. Which will free up more capital to 
						increase the amount you can leverage towards another potential property. Yes, that's
						right, once you have 20%+ paid off on a property, you can free up some of that money and
						put towards a down payment on another property.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					So above are a few examples why real estate is a sure way to goes when is comes to putting
					your cash towards a safe stable investment.

				<p>Why invest in coffee parcels? Lets bring perspective.
				Coffee is the 2nd most traded commodity in the world as the 
				runner-up to the 1st most traded commodity in the world, oil.
				Even one with half a brain cell realizes there may be something
				to investments in coffee parcels.</p>
				<p>Coffee parcels can run as low as $15,000.00 which provides you
				a turn-key investment. Basically you provide the capital, and the
				farms will provide the labor, production and distribution. You gain 
				a small percent in the first coming years, but after several years,
				you can gain as high as 49% returns from your parcel. The other benefit
				is this investment is outside of state. So U.S. laws and regulations have
				no effect on your land, yes it is your land. Uncle Sam can't tough this.</p>
				<p>Why no invest in a constant growing investment where you receive a continuous
				return every year, while providing a sustainable life for the local workers whom
				work your land. Yes, more than a quarter of the gains from your parcel will go
				back to the people who work your parcel. I don't know about you, but gaining
				money and helping lives, it's a win win</p>

					<p>Godda love that chocolate!!!</p>
				</div>
				<div class="vm-pics" id="invest-pic-3"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="vm-p-container">
				<p>Why would one invest in cocoa? My question for you is,
				why would you not? Cocoa, the pure form of what we all love
				chocolate is a big player in the economical and business markets
				around the world. Chocolate is a $98 billion industry worldwide and with
				a 30% project increase by the year 2020, this is a extremely sustainable
				market.</p>
				<p>Cocoa parcels go for a little higher than your coffee parcels. They average
				around $20,000.00+, but like coffee, they provide a large return when the
				parcel is producing. And of course, a nice portion goes back to the farmers whom
				work those crops. Which in the end, makes everyone happy.</p>
